    "I have written a special method to make inspecting the savegame easier. Its purpose is twofold:\n",
    "1. **Properly decode all values**: The savegame is stored as one big XML tree. However, the preprocessing tools only return an XML tree where the text of the leaf nodes is encoded hexadecimal. E.g. the GUID 180045 is encoded as DB0FC93F (hexadeximal representation of a 32-bit integer). The interpreter converts the values before displaying\n",
    "2. **Give a compact overview**: The XML tree contains many arrays (e.g. for islands, objects, etc.) Displaying them in the same way as other XML editors do, this results in a very long output. The inspector instead fuses all items in an array. This has the advantage that one can see all possible child nodes. If those child nodes have different values, they are displayed as an array (e.g. ['1', '2']). For better readability, long arrays and values are truncate. The number next to a node name states how many objects were fused. If you see something like: ': 200' (i.e. the node name is missing). This means there is an array that contains both simple values (without a node name) and complex objects. Those are serialized dictionaries in the form: key1, value1, key2, value2, ...\n",
